# Colorized Games

These games were originally available as black & white games and were colorized for use with the Chroma 81.

## Details

Colorization works by loading a program prior to loading the game. This program will check if the Chroma 81 expansion is installed, and, if it is, configures the colors of the ZX81 characters, and then loads the original game, which runs unaware that it's playing with colors.

Since **81-libretro** can't load arbitrary programs from the file system, the colorization program and the game must exist in the same file. The `tzx` files available here were made in the original EightyOne emulator by inserting the two `p` files into one tape and saving it as a `tzx` file.

## Copyright

The games and colorization programs are [copyrighted by their original authors](http://www.fruitcake.plus.com/Sinclair/ZX81/Chroma/ChromaInterface_Software_Colourised.htm).

Specifically:

* ZX81 Pacman and ZX81 Kong are available for download here with permission from Paul Farrow, and are available at [his website](http://www.fruitcake.plus.com/). He's also the author of most of the colorization programs used in the `tzx` files.
* The UDG version of ZX-Galaxians was made by Kelly Murta, and can also be download  from [his website](http://zx81.eu5.org/). He's also the author of some of the colorization programs used here.

## More colorized games

There are four additional colorized games available for download at the ZX81 section of the [Bob's Stuff](https://bobs-stuff.co.uk/) website: Miner Man, Noir Shapes, Pandemic, and Virus. Look for the `tzx` files inside the `zip` archives.
