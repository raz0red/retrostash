TS2048.DCK
----------

Timex Sinclair 2048 emulator. This DCK file is similar like SPECEMU.DCK,
(Spectrum emulator cartridge in DOCK bank), but TS2048.DCK is loaded into HOME
bank and it will replace Timex HOME ROM with Spectrum ROM (like in TS2048) so
you will directly enter Spectrum mode, unlike SPECEMU.DCK which is loaded into
DOCK bank and must be manually started with OUT 244,3 (so SPECEMU.DCK allows
both Timex and Spectrum mode).
